## Spring 2021 DH 110 - User Experience and Design 
### Hana Yerin Lim 

## Description
I decided to explore the user experience side of LinkedIn and Facebook because they are some of the most used among younger generations (millennials and Gen-Z). Although LinkedIn and Facebook are some of the most popular websites used by billions of people, users might experience some discomforts using them. LinkedIn is perhaps the most well-known employment-oriented online platform that provides users to find employment, extend their networks, and learn new materials. I believe I use LinkedIn just as much as other people to seek opportunities, but I've recently been experiencing annoyance and difficulty using it.

|Rating|Description|
|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|1	|Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project|
|2	|Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority|
|3	|Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority|

## Website 1: LinkedIn

### Heuristic Evaluation of LinkedIn 
|Heuristic Description|Severity Rating|Heuristic Evaluation|Possible Solution for Ranks 2, 3|
|:---------------------:|:---------------:|--------------------|----------------------|
|Visibility of system status|2|For LinkedIn quick apply, it is doing a good job in showing the progress bar with my application so that I can have a better idea on where I am with the progress. LinkedIn could do a better job though on showing the visibility of system status after submitting the applications because I've seen other companies having transparent application progress. Most of the times the application progress is not updated, but I do understand that it could be hard to track down all millions of applications to a lot of the companies. Since the alternative method of getting updates is via email directly from the company, but I said to be a minor issue because a lot of my applications go into the junk. | Make sure the application process is synced with each company. 
|Match between system and real world|1|In terms of the match between system and real world, LinkedIn uses beginner-friendly terms so that every age groups can understand the website terms and navigate pretty easily. |
|User control and freedom|2|There is a reaction button for each post, and it is pretty easy to redo and undo the reaction stickers. However, when messaging, there is no option to undo sending a message, even if I sent it as a mistake. Another point is that once I submit my application, there is no option to withdraw. One of the competing platform called Handshake has an option to withdraw. 
|Consistency and standards|1|I believe LinkedIn is pretty consistent with the design and keeps the standard. I expect the logo to be on the topleft of the website, and I have the navigation bar on the top as I expected. It is pretty easy to navigate through different places. 
|Error prevention|1| Although LinkedIn doesn't have a feature of a pop-up error making sure the user has everything ready to go, users can edit their errors and frequently update their posts and profiles. When submitting the application, there is a review section to go over my whole application in the end so this has been helpful for the users. 
|Recognition rather than recall|2|LinkedIn doesn't specifically have options to choose tags (interests/industry), but it has the search bar to put in a specific keywords that the users are interested. 
|Flexibility and efficiency of use|1| I believe it is efficient for users when using LinkedIn because on top of the basic features, there are filter buttons to do advanced searched. 
|Aesthetic and minimalist design|1| Although LinkedIn doesn't have the best design and indeed not that minimalistic, I understand that this website needs many information presented as possible. I think it needs not be fixed unless it is worth their time and effort. 
|Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors|3|The biggest point with using LinkedIn is getting way too frequent error whenever I try to navigate to a different page. It has been quite a while since I've been getting errors like "Couldn't find the page request", and this always frustrated me as I had to refresh page a couple of times. Since I'm not getting any similar types of error on other websites, I believe it is the unique error from LinkedIn, and it is a major problem that their tech team has to fix as soon as possible. 
|Help and documentation|1| LinkedIn has a separate help page with a lot of the common questions on the left side of the page. There is also a search section we can type in specific question. So far, I haven't had any questions using LinkedIn. 


## Website 2: Facebook 
### Information about Facebook webpage 
https://www.facebook.com/
