### Heuristic Evaluation of LinkedIn 
|Heuristic Description|Severity Rating|Heuristic Evaluation|
|:---------------------:|:---------------:|--------------------|
|Visibility of system status|2|For LinkedIn quick apply, it is doing a good job in showing the progress bar with my application so that I can have a better idea on where I am with the progress. LinkedIn could do a better job though on showing the visibility of system status after submitting the applications because I've seen other companies having transparent application progress. Most of the times the application progress is not updated, but I do understand that it could be hard to track down all millions of applications to a lot of the companies. Since the alternative method of getting updates is via email directly from the company, but I said to be a minor issue because a lot of my applications go into the junk. 
|Match between system and real world|1|In terms of the match between system and real world, LinkedIn uses beginner-friendly terms so that every age groups can understand the website terms and navigate pretty easily. 
|User control and freedom|2|There is a reaction button for each post, and it is pretty easy to redo and undo the reaction stickers. However, when messaging, there is no option to undo sending a message, even if I sent it as a mistake. Another point is that once I submit my application, there is no option to withdraw. One of the competing platform called Handshake has an option to withdraw. 
|Consistency and standards|1|I believe LinkedIn is pretty consistent with the design and keeps the standard. I expect the logo to be on the topleft of the website, and I have the navigation bar on the top as I expected. It is pretty easy to navigate through different places. 
|Error prevention|1| Although LinkedIn doesn't have a feature of a pop-up error making sure the user has everything ready to go, users can edit their errors and frequently update their posts and profiles. When submitting the application, there is a review section to go over my whole application in the end so this has been helpful for the users. 
|Recognition rather than recall|2|
|Flexibility and efficiency of use|
|Aesthetic and minimalist design|
|Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors|
|Help and documentation|
