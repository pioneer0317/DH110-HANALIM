### Marcus' Scenario
**Why?**
* Marcus is a 32-year-old senior digital marketing analyst at WarnerMedia. During his Bachelor's and Master's degrees, Marcus studied business economics and marketing. He had worked at many different media companies ever since his first internship. During eight years of work experience, Marcus gained a lot of self-confidence and learned not to fear the challenge. Based on his experience so far, his job as a digital marketing analyst seems to be a right fit. However, everything he sees from work is too familiar and repetitive. He wants to feel the same passion when he first started his job and so seeks a new start. He wants to challenge himself and decides to make a big change and transition into the tech company, as he has been working for the media company for almost a decade. Despite his goals and plans, it doesn't change the fact that he is a very busy professional working day and night for a conglomerate corporation. After searching some job availabilities online, he noticed different job boards posted the same job opportunities on different dates, which he found very frustrating. Marcus certainly believes there must be a better way to make good usage of his time on job searching and recording.

**How?** 
* After hours of job search, Marcus realizes the ads on his Chrome are all about the job board platforms. The one that catches his attention is a platform called []. He logs in using his Gmail account and sees there is an advanced filter. There are checkboxes next to each option, so he chooses options "words that contain" [Senior Digital Marketing Analyst] and "words must include" [Marketing, Analyst]. The location filter also has choices of specific regions and broad regions like the east coast, south-west coast, so he chooses the west coast because he wants to see more options. He notices that the job board website information is written next to each search, which he thinks is nice because he doesn't have to use three different websites like LinkedIn, Indeed, and Lensa to search. A few of the opportunities catch his attention, so he decides to apply right away. While navigating [], he notices the list of the companies he just applied to has been automatically created. The list includes the information of date, name of the company, link to the job description, which job board, location, position, and binary column of received reply. He also finds out that there is an option to get the notification if the company hasn't replied after a month so that he can discard or send a follow-up email. Marcus thinks he is so lucky to find out about [] as this system was exactly what he was looking for for a while. He is very excited to use his time wisely and be organized with his job searching process.

### Theodore's Scenario 
**Why?** 
* Theodore retired at the age of 62, and he was an editorial content manager at Wolfram for ten years. He studied Literature at Pomona College in California for his Bachelor's degree. Although Theodore retired a while ago, he always wants to live a productive life, and that age shouldn't prevent him from working hard. He has a six-year-old granddaughter, who is Theodore's joy of life. His granddaughter loves listening to his stories about the books and his past experiences. For various reasons, he decides to take a new journey as a freelancer/consultant. He first opened Craigslist, but felt like a lot of them were untrustworthy. He then tried going online to find a job, but it was too hard for him as there were so many different job boards websites. Theodore shared his thoughts with his son, and he supported Theodore's goal. Theodore asked for advice and help on where to start, and his son suggested to him a job board called LinkedIn. However, Theodore doesn't like the clustered and busy page. He gets lost pretty easily and takes time to figure out something by himself. He is hoping to find one platform that includes all the functions he is expected to use without help from his son.

**How?** 
* Theodore meets up with his friends regularly at the bar, and he shares his current situation and frustration. One of his friends, Bob, is tech-savvy and has a daughter, a software engineer, who keeps up with the latest trends. To help Theodore out, Bob explains Theodore's situation to Bob's daughter, and she introduces him about []. Theodore tries this webpage and sees that [] has a simplistic and eye-pleasing design. There is also a step-by-step guide tailored for first-time users. Theodore is thrilled that he can easily navigate through different pages without much help. After taking a tour, Theodore types Editor consultant and specifies his location at Champaign, IL. The font of the result page isn't too small, so he is satisfied with it. He finds several of the job descriptions that he likes and applies to those companies. After a few days, he already received a reply from one of the companies. Inspired by his story, the company wants to set up an interview with Theodore. To prepare well for his interview, he clicks the list and finds the information about this company to go through their expectation. Theodore doesn't have to worry about getting confused with loads of information on google anymore. He is satisfied with using [] and feels like he can get a position anytime soon.
