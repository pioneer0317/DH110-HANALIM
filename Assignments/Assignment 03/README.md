## Step 01: Specify the main design challenge 

**What is the main activity your project would support the usersâ€™ needs?**
> There are many different resources the users can use to apply for jobs, such as LinkedIn, Indeed, Handshake, specific company websites, etc. This project will support the users with managing and tracking their submitted applications by uniting from one app/platform and getting notified when the users haven't heard back from the company after a month with the possibility of sending out a follow-up email. 

**What is the basic need involved for that activity?** 
> This activity fulfills the user's efficiency with job hunting as they can be overwhelmed and confused with loads of job applications and the number of different websites they use. 
This project aims to organize and save the users time to be more productive and effective with their job application process. 

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?** 
> The current typical solution to satisfy this need is an individual's google sheet to update by him/herself. I haven't found a specific app/platform that functions as a hub. I am aware that most people rely on each career website that saves the company information that the user's applied, but this could be a hassle as it is hard to keep up to date when there are different websites used. 

**What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**
> There are a few limitations to point out. Users can sometimes be forgetful to update their application status on google sheet and don't remember through which platform they applied to a specific place. This can cause spending a lot more than the necessary time. Creating an app/platform that becomes a hub that manages and tracks the applications automatically can be very helpful and comfortable for the users. They would have a positive experience using this app when the app sorts and organizes everything for them. 

## Step 02: Target users 

**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)**
> * Demographics: All the job seekers (all age range but with a very few age groups less than 18-year-old)
> * Preferences: Users desire to land successfully into a job market. They are determined to be as much efficient as possible with their job process. 
> * Expertise: No particular level of expertise is needed to use this application. 

**Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)**
 > Users can perform this activity anytime, anywhere. However, it would be more convenient for them to use personal laptops or desktops since they would have to record all the information right after their submission. 

**What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)**
> The target users will want to make sure they hear back from the companies they have applied to. Typically, the users will use google sheets or microsoft Excel to record and keep track of all the company information. 

## Step 03: Pick research methods (or a combination of methods)

> To get a better idea of creating a platform tailored to users', I conducted an interview and participatory observation research with a friend who is part of the targeted demographic. Due to the current situation, this session was conducted via Zoom. 

> The interview and participatory observation research was held in the following order: 

> 1. Background questions 
> * To conduct an efficient interview, I asked some background questions to apply this knowledge to later questions. 
> 2. General question/contextual inquiry 
> * I asked general questions about the job application and recording process. 
> 3. Participatory observation/user activity 
> * I let the interviewer show me how he would usually perform a job search and job submission. The user thoroughly walked through his thought process. 
> 4. Problems 
> * I asked him several questions about any problems or inconvenience with the current methods of maintaining a list of places he has applied to and the job searching process. 
> 5. other questions 
> * I asked other questions that I've not asked in the previous questions. I asked him, "do you prefer to have this function" type of questions to get a clearer idea of what kind of features the users might want on the new platform. 
> 6. closing questions 
>
> More detailed information can be found from Step 04.

## Step 06: Reflection
**Interesting and insightful quotes from the interviewee: **

1. Do you believe the way you keep track of the places you've applied to is efficient?
> (5:41) I'll more likely use Microsoft Word or Google Google Docs or something like that, because it's just easier to use and navigate as opposed to excel, Excel has a little bit of a learning curve.
2. What are the work values? And which factor Do you consider the most? When deciding which place to place?
> (8:19) ... that that particular job was was really nice because everyone their work together knew each other and we're all very, super friendly to customers and to each other, right? So, so places like that, I would value 100 times more, even if the work was a lot harder, just are nicer you know, so being happy Good working synergy is good.
3. Would you rely on the job boards with keeping track of the record or would you just use a Microsoft Word (interviewee's method of keeping the list) to keep track of the places? 
> (18:42) "I would probably rely on indeed, if they had something like that, or something that I trusted like that, you know, um, but I like keeping track just for my sake. So I'm not having to, you know, go back and forth, because I don't always use all the functions of the actual website itself."
4. How much time would you spend on this task?
> (21:34) I'm closer to an hour of applying to places as opposed to, you know, several hours.
5. Would it be more approachable for you to apply for jobs when every information you need is sorted, managed and organized automatically by itself instead of you manually just inputting information?
> (27:25) Yeah, that would be nice. That'd be really nice. Yeah.
6. Can you rate the importance of a job application like recording process to you on a scale one to ten? 
> (30:01) ... However, I have had friends who when they graduated, they applied to like 1000s of places because they need to find a job and they just got their degree, and they're ready to get going. And I'm sure for them having a system other than just an Excel spreadsheet or word spreadsheet or Word document, it would be a lot better for that. Right? Or a lot better for someone who's applying to to real companies and jobs

The contextual inquiry process was a new experience for me, and I learned a lot from this exercise. It was a great opportunity to observe the same questions from other person's perspective. I realized even the basic questions we saw them through different lenses. 

My interviewee suggested a brilliant idea about the filter features from the job boards. His suggestion was to have a "student-friendly" option, which will allow students to not waste time on seeing the jobs with "weekday or overnight" descriptions. The interviewee also claimed that the current students seeking internships, recent grads, and any job seekers seeking full-time opportunities would find the idea of having a "job tracking" system extremely helpful. In this way, they wouldn't have to manually put down the information of the companies they've applied to.
