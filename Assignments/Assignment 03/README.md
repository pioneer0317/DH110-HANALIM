## Step 01: Specify the main design challenge 

**What is the main activity your project would support the usersâ€™ needs?**
> There are many different resources the users can use to apply for jobs, such as LinkedIn, Indeed, Handshake, specific company websites, etc. This project will support the users with managing and tracking their submitted applications by uniting from one app/platform and getting notified when the users haven't heard back from the company after a month with the possibility of sending out a follow-up email. 

**What is the basic need involved for that activity?** 
> This activity fulfills the user's efficiency with job hunting as they can be overwhelmed and confused with loads of job applications and the number of different websites they use. 
This project aims to organize and save the users time to be more productive and effective with their job application process. 

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?** 
> The current typical solution to satisfy this need is an individual's google sheet to update by him/herself. I haven't found a specific app/platform that functions as a hub. I am aware that most people rely on each career website that saves the company information that the user's applied, but this could be a hassle as it is hard to keep up to date when there are different websites used. 

**What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**
> There are a few limitations to point out. Users can sometimes be forgetful to update their application status on google sheet and don't remember through which platform they applied to a specific place. This can cause spending a lot more than the necessary time. Creating an app/platform that becomes a hub that manages and tracks the applications automatically can be very helpful and comfortable for the users. They would have a positive experience using this app when the app sorts and organizes everything for them. 

## Step 02: Target users 

**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)**
> * Demographics: All the job seekers (all age range but with a very few age groups less than 18-year-old)
> * Preferences: Users desire to land successfully into a job market. They are determined to be as much efficient as possible with their job process. 
> * Expertise: No particular level of expertise is needed to use this application. 

**Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)**
 

**What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)**

## Step 03: Pick research methods (or a combination of methods)

> To get a better idea of creating a platform tailored to users', I conducted an interview and participatory observation research with a friend who is part of the targeted demographic. Due to the current situation, this session was conducted via Zoom. 

> The interview and participatory observation research was held in the following order: 

> 1. Background questions 
> * To conduct an efficient interview, I asked some background questions to apply this knowledge to later questions. 
> 2. General question/contextual inquiry 
> * I asked general questions about the job application and recording process. 
> 3. Participatory observation/user activity 
> * I let the interviewer show me how he would usually perform a job search and job submission. The user thoroughly walked through his thought process. 
> 4. Problems 
> * I asked him several questions about any problems or inconvenience with the current methods of maintaining a list of places he has applied to and the job searching process. 
> 5. other questions 
> * I asked other questions that I've not asked in the previous questions. I asked him, "do you prefer to have this function" type of questions to get a clearer idea of what kind of features the users might want on the new platform. 
> 6. closing questions 
>
> More detailed information can be found from Step 04.

## Step 06: Reflection
Insights from the data: 


In github (sub)repository assignment4, create one document (either README.md or .html)
Describe your project design challenge + target user (step1+2)
Describe your research methods and plan (step3)
Provide a link to your interview/observation guide (step4) 
Digitize your notes (scan/photo) and upload your data to github
Provide a link to your representative data file(s) (step5)
Provide a link to the transcript of your interview (or meaningful dialogues/ talk-aloud during observation, useful transcript tool here) 
Write a reflection
