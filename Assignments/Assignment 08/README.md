# Seekr: Easier Job Searching and Job Tracker App 
## DH 110 project by Hana Yerin Lim

### Introduction
This project fulfills the user's efficiency with job hunting as they can be overwhelmed and confused with loads of job applications and the number of different websites they use. This project aims to organize and save the users time to be more productive and effective with their job application process. The goal of this project is to create a system that automatically organizes, manages, and keep track of the companies record. With some possible improvements on some of the issues, this new app/platform that can satisfy the user's needs.

### Design statement
There are many different resources the users can use to apply for jobs, such as LinkedIn, Indeed, Handshake, specific company websites, etc. Although thousands of people use these websites to job hunt, users might experience some discomforts using them. LinkedIn is perhaps the most well-known employment-oriented online platform that provides users to find employment, extend their networks, and learn new materials. I believe I use LinkedIn just as much as other people to seek opportunities, but I've recently been experiencing inconvenience using it. One of the biggest issue with specifically LinkedIn is too frequent error, busy and maximalist design, and user control and freedom. Most of the job hunters are probably tired of reading and finding countless job descriptions and annoyed if they see repeated information from different websites. Efficiency, time saving, and easy navigation are the biggest need for job seekers. 

### Competitor analysis: Heuristic Evaluation on LinkedIn
https://www.linkedin.com/

LinkedIn is an American business and employment-oriented online service that operates via websites and mobile apps. Launched on May 5, 2003, the platform is mainly used for professional networking and allows job seekers to post their CVs and employers to post jobs.

Overall Evaluation: Besides some of the strengths with the user experience components, The most critical problem with LinkedIn is the amount of error occurring more than half of the time when using the product. This bug needs to be fixed as soon as possible because no content nor a bad connection is the cause of the error. Another minor issue would be the inflexibility of withdrawing/undoing submitted applications. Some other competitive websites do have options to withdraw from the job position, which users might find helpful if they want to make any changes. Updates on the application process would be very helpful as the number of them is not shown. In addition to these major and minor points, more is discussed in the following table.

### Competitor analysis: Usability Testing on Facebook
Similar to one of LinkedIn's networking features, Facebook is one of the most popular global social networking services that operates via websites and mobile apps. The platform is mainly used for entertainment/socializing purposes and allows users to connect with friends through chat, groups, events, posts, and tag features. The users can also get entertained through various games and videos. With the recently added feature, users can also actively buy or sell the products through the Facebook marketplace.

After conducting a heuristic evaluation on the Facebook website, several problems and concerns are addressed. First, Facebook doesn't have a good recommendation algorithm. It doesn't have an interest tags list for users to choose from, and it is not easy to change the video recommendation preference. Second, the aesthetic design of the website is very cluttered and overwhelming. Third, Facebook consistency is lacking as its design frequently changes when it introduces a new feature. Lastly, the efficiency lacks, as there are redundant tab options on different navigation bars, which can increase the user's dissatisfaction.

With these usability issues, I performed a usability test to find the factors that contribute to decreasing user satisfaction and the efficiency of using the website. The usability test intends to discover the flaws and improve on these points. The purpose of this session is to analyze user behavior for a potential improvement. In the test, a user is asked to complete a short series of tasks and describe his/her thought process.

### User research [contextual inquiry]
To get a better idea of creating a platform tailored to user's needs, I conducted an interview and participatory observation research with a friend who is part of the targeted demographic. The purpose of this user research is to

The contextual inquiry process was a new experience for me, and I liked how I could hear more from the participant from this interview than from the usability test. It was a great opportunity to observe the same questions from other person's perspective. I realized even the basic questions we saw them through different lenses. I already envisioned the potential product on what kind of functionality it'll have. The partcipant and I had some of the similar ideas on the topic, and his answers confirmed with me that having a systematic job recording process would be very helpful for any job seekers. Some of his answers, though, allowed me to step further into the thinking process. My interviewee suggested a brilliant idea about the filter features from the job boards. His suggestion was to have a "student-friendly" option, which will allow students to not waste time on seeing the jobs with "weekday or overnight" descriptions. The interviewee also claimed that the current students seeking internships, recent grads, and any job seekers seeking full-time opportunities would find the idea of having a "job tracking" system extremely helpful. In this way, they wouldn't have to manually put down the information of the companies they've applied to. He also mentioned that it would be more approachable to him to be more active in applying if he knew there was such a system. Although this session was very helpful for me in terms of getting to know the participant and his approach to the task, it was challenging to come up with in-depth and diverse interview questions. I am satisfied with my first practice, and if I were to do anything differently, it would be nice to hear from multiple other job seekers and I would try to come up with better and more insightful interview questions.

### UX storytelling 
The purpose of UX storytelling is to get the opportunity to understand the user's emotion, behavior, thought process, and actions. This practice allows the developers to proceed with their designing process without the bias. When creating different personas, the designers can figure out the gain and the pain points, and find a way to make a product that is tailored to user's need. It is a great way to observe the situations and scenarios from their perspective, and get a better sense of how users act in certain types of conflicts and what they feel when they use the product.

For this project, I have created three personas. I have identified their goals, motivation, needs, challenges and frustrations, as well as their empathy map and the journey map to get a better idea of their thought process and the conversion. 

This is an example of Theodore's persona:
