## Spring 2021 DH 110 - User Experience and Design 
### Hana Yerin Lim 

## Introduction 
Facebook is one of the most popular global social networking services that operates via websites and mobile apps. The platform is mainly used for entertainment/socializing purposes and allows users to connect with friends through chat, groups, events, posts, and tag features. The users can also get entertained through various games and videos. With the recently added feature, users can also actively buy or sell the products through the Facebook marketplace. 

After conducting a heuristic evaluation on the Facebook website, several problems and concerns are addressed. First, Facebook doesn't have a good recommendation algorithm. It doesn't have an interest tags list for users to choose from, and it is not easy to change the video recommendation preference. Second, the aesthetic design of the website is very cluttered and overwhelming. Third, Facebook consistency is lacking as its design frequently changes when it introduces a new feature. Lastly, the efficiency lacks, as there are redundant tab options on different navigation bars, which can increase the user's dissatisfaction. 

With these usability issues, I will perform a usability test to find the factors that contribute to decreasing user satisfaction and the efficiency of using the website. The usability test intends to discover the flaws and improve on these points. The purpose of this session is to analyze user behavior for a potential improvement. In the test, a user is asked to complete a short series of tasks and describe his/her thought process.
