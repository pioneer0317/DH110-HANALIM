# Pilot Usability Test - Facebook

## Introduction 
Facebook is one of the most popular global social networking services that operates via websites and mobile apps. The platform is mainly used for entertainment/socializing purposes and allows users to connect with friends through chat, groups, events, posts, and tag features. The users can also get entertained through various games and videos. With the recently added feature, users can also actively buy or sell the products through the Facebook marketplace. 

After conducting a heuristic evaluation on the Facebook website, several problems and concerns are addressed. First, Facebook doesn't have a good recommendation algorithm. It doesn't have an interest tags list for users to choose from, and it is not easy to change the video recommendation preference. Second, the aesthetic design of the website is very cluttered and overwhelming. Third, Facebook consistency is lacking as its design frequently changes when it introduces a new feature. Lastly, the efficiency lacks, as there are redundant tab options on different navigation bars, which can increase the user's dissatisfaction. 

With these usability issues, I will perform a usability test to find the factors that contribute to decreasing user satisfaction and the efficiency of using the website. The usability test intends to discover the flaws and improve on these points. The purpose of this session is to analyze user behavior for a potential improvement. In the test, a user is asked to complete a short series of tasks and describe his/her thought process.

## Methodology 

The pilot usability test will be held virtually using each other's personal laptop. The moderator and the participant will turn on the camera to communicate. Both will use Zoom to record the participant's reactions throughout the test and will display the participant's screen to follow up with the test. 

The process of the usability test will go as the following:
After introducing the pilot usability test, the moderator will get a consent from the participant. The participant will start off with some background questions to check if they have a previous experience using this website. Then the participant will fill out the pre-test questionnaire which tests their first impression on the website. After answering these pre-test questionnaires, the participant will be answering three of the Task & Scenario questions. The participant navigating through the website as they try to accomplish the tasks will be monitored by screen sharing. The participant will then answer post-test questions to measure the usability of the website. Some of the questions are measured (seven-point Likert scale) questions and some require to choose five words that match the user's impression on the website. The results that are measured are: 
frequency of the use, ease of use, difficulty of use, site aesthetic, site organization, inconsistency, and learning ability. After completing the post-test questionnaires, the test ends after participant has filled out the demographic information.

## Reflection 
The opportunity allowed me to learn more about the usability of the Facebook website, and how others can perceive the same situation differently. 

To start off with the usability of the Facebook website, I learned that the major reason of the participant for using Facebook is to communicate with friends via messenger. I learned that it is pretty easy to use the website by the first look, but the aesthetic design of the website is just the average (although the user input average, she murmured the design to be boring). Based on the participant's reaction, the biggest problem with the website is that it is unnecessarily complex, very cumbersome, there are too much inconsistencies, and not as easy to use as a social media platform. Although she said it is easy to use the platform now since she got used to it, she expressed that it might be hard for new users to learn how to use this website very quickly. The five words that the participant chose are boring, busy, familiar, old, and professional. 

From the testing progress, I learned that it is not as easy as it seems to be a moderator. I had to make sure I was on the participant's pace, and needed to know how to control the participant's speed. I realized when the participant started to answer the questions in a fast pace, I noticed I was also speaking as if someone would chase me. I also think the moderator needs to make sure he/she provides a comfortable atmosphere since it could be unfamiliar for the participant. I should have probed the participant more to speak out loud, which I realized how important the moderator role is to make the participant engaged with the test.
