# Assignment 05: Low Fidelity Prototype
## DH 110 | Hana Yerin Lim 

## Description of the Project 
**Purpose:**

Rather than focusing on the aesthetic side of the product, the purpose of the low-fidelity prototype is to test the functionality and the flow of the features and to check if the features are tailored to the user's needs. 

**User research + Persona + Three features:**

Through usability testing of the existing job board (LinkedIn), contextual inquiry of a targeted user, user persona exercise, and insight from my personal experience, I created a low-fidelity prototype with significant features to perform the given tasks.
The current project aims to create a job tracker that lists the companies applied in a spreadsheet format and to allow the user to access the job postings from a system rather than from many different job boards. The goal is to increase the user's efficiency and management with job hunting to prevent the user from being overwhelmed and confused with loads of job applications and job postings from different websites. The targeted community is all the job seekers (all age range but with a very few age groups less than 18-year-old). According to the previous usability test and the interview, people from the targeted community are not too satisfied and seek improvement with the current methods of job boards. After gathering insights from previous testings, these are the features that can mitigate the dissatisfaction and be geared towards a significant improvement. 

1. Advanced filters - More specified filters that include more options for location (ex: west, south-west, east, etc), students (position for student/non-student), title and description (flexible and more advanced ways of including certain words). A platform that unites all the job board websites' job postings into this app/website so the user can get the latest and earliest possible updates
2. Personalized record - The automated list of the companies users applied organized and managed from the system; users can always come back to this list and refresh their memories on job descriptions or the date they applied
3. Follow-up Notification on application: If the company hasn't responded after a month, users receive a notification and can choose different possible options: either cold email the companies or discard that job application (cross out from the list).

## Tasks
The following tasks are tested by the participant for the low-fidelity prototype:
1. Filter location, keyword, and student-friendly to search a job
2. After applying, check if the information is automatically listed in the job tracker
3. Select skills and bio to show on the user’s profile
4. Update the resume
5. Change the follow-up notification from unresponsive companies

Details on tester's confusion/unexpected interaction/successful factors: [PDF file](Wireflow_Test_walk-through.pdf)

Tester demographic: Asian, age within 60-70, not tech-savvy (user persona similar to Theodore McCarthy) 
Personal note on the tester's confusion or unexpected interaction: 
1. Filter location, keyword, and student-friendly to search a job
> Unexpectedly, my tester ran into a problem searching for a job using the filter function. She instead proposed an unexpected interaction and suggestion. She said having a filter function in the middle is very nice to have, but from there, it was uncomfortable for her to complete the search. Instead, she expressed that she wanted to see a separate apply or submit button directly under the filter section so that it is easier for at least the older age groups to complete the task. 
2. After applying, check if the information is automatically listed in the job tracker
> The tester was able to complete this task without any hesitation. 
3. Select skills and bio to show on the user’s profile
> She got confused about where to find control of the visibility. She suggested that it is okay to keep the control on the settings page, but it would be nice to also have the ability to control on the bio page. She also expressed that as an old person, she always has been scared to use the settings page because of the lack of explanation and overwhelming information. She asked if I could add a sentence or two to have a description on the top of the page. 
4. Update the resume
> She sort of hesitated to find the update button, so she said that it would be better to have an update button next to the document section. 
5. Change the follow-up notification from unresponsive companies
> Once again, she tried to go to the job tracker page instead of settings, so she suggested to have the ability to control also on this job tracker page.

## Reflection
The overall experience was very interesting and helpful for me to learn more about how the product is made. I liked that I could be creative with designing the functionality of the product. To be honest, at first, when I did the wireframing and prototyping, I thought I got every detail and felt like this low-fidelity would be in a good shape, ready to move on to the next stage. However, once the tester worked on the given tasks to test the product, I realized there was so much to improve. Most of all, I had a tester with an older age group this time, which I got to learn how they thought of the technology and how easier I could design the product to satisfy all the age group's experiences. 

Wireframing and prototyping went more smoothly than I expected. I think that was because I tried to do everything step by step. I first started by having more boxes and buttons to sort out the design. Then, I tried to add the details as I was thinking of the previous activities I've done. Then the prototyping went pretty well. The tester also didn't mention any discomfort with the design flow. 

Based on the tester's feedback, I changed and added a few spots to make a better and more usable product. The things I changed are: 
1. Clarify the titles - profile/documents into profile/update documents, Search into Quick search
2. Arrange the filters in the order of most frequently used
3. Add the ability to control the visibility status on each Bio and Job Tracker pages
4. Add update buttons next to each document instead of clicking the words 
5. Add textboxes for the tips and guides - if the user chooses not to get the guide, there is an option to skip 

This was a great exercise for me to observe and think from a wider perspective. I would try to think more from the older age group perspective so that the product can be beginner-friendly to not just the younger age groups but also the older age groups.
